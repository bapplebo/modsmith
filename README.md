# Modsmith

### [Kaedrin's](https://github.com/Kaedrin/warhammer-mod-manager) manager is by far and large the better mod manager - this one was built to handle a few specific needs I needed, as well as a learning exercise. Please use that instead of this one, to be honest.

## About
A mod manager for Total War: Warhammer II and Total War: Three Kingdoms. Will add support for Total War: Warhammer III eventually, and maybe other games if there's popular demand.

## Installation

TBD, an installer will probably come eventually but for now you can run it through Visual Studio, or publish it from there.

## Building

I don't actually know what else you need, so here's what I used

Visual Studio 2022 (slightly older versions may work?)
Windows 10

## Credits
Kaedrin and their [mod manager](https://github.com/Kaedrin/warhammer-mod-manager), from which I've been inspired and taken a few ideas to implement in this one.


## Contributing

Pull requests welcome.
